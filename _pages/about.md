I am a Ph.D. student at the [Swiss AI Lab (IDSIA)](https://www.idsia.ch), where I am advised by [JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber](https://people.idsia.ch//~juergen/). 
In general, I am interested in various aspects of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
My current research focuses on reinforcement learning and I am particularly interested in leveraging ideas from deep learning to tackle problems like exploration and temporal credit assignment in a scalable manner. 

Previously, I completed my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Lugano (USI).
