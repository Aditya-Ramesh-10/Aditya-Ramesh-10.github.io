I am a Ph.D. student at the [Swiss AI Lab (IDSIA)](https://www.idsia.ch), where I am advised by [JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber](https://people.idsia.ch//~juergen/). 
My current research focuses on leveraging ideas from deep learning to tackle problems like exploration and credit assignment in reinforcement learning. 
Previously, I completed my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Lugano (USI).
