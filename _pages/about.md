I am a Ph.D. student at the [Swiss AI Lab (IDSIA)](https://www.idsia.ch), where I am advised by [JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber](https://people.idsia.ch//~juergen/). 
Previously, I completed my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Lugano (USI).

In general, I am interested in various aspects of understanding intelligence, with the goal of developing algorithms that can solve problems that are presently beyond human capabilities.
My current research focuses on reinforcement learning. 
I am particularly interested in tackling problems like exploration and temporal credit assignment in a scalable manner.
