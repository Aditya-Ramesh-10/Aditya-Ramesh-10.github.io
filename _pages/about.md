I am a Ph.D. student at the [Swiss AI Lab (IDSIA-USI)](https://www.idsia.ch), where I am advised by Prof. [JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber](https://people.idsia.ch//~juergen/).

My research is focused on understanding intelligence and building intelligent agents that can solve problems beyond current human capabilities. Specifically, my work centers on reinforcement learning. I am particularly interested in:

- Exploration in complex, sparse-reward environments
- Temporal credit assignment in long-horizon tasks
- Scalable architectures and learning algorithms for deep reinforcement learning
