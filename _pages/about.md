I am a Ph.D. student at the [Swiss AI Lab (IDSIA)](https://www.idsia.ch), where I am advised by [JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber](https://people.idsia.ch//~juergen/). 
In general, I am interested in various aspects of machine learning and artificial intelligence, with the goal of developing algorithms that can solve problems that are beyond present human capabilities.
My current research focuses on reinforcement learning. 
I am particularly interested in leveraging ideas from deep learning to tackle issues like exploration and temporal credit assignment in a scalable manner. 

Previously, I completed my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Lugano (USI).
